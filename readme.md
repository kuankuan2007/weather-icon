# Weather Icons

This is a project of weather icons, designed using Adobe Illustrator, with 68 gradient-style icons covering the weather codes of Amap. These icons can be used to display different weather conditions and are suitable for websites, applications, or other media.

## Installation and Usage

To use these icons, you need to install Adobe Illustrator software, which can be downloaded as a trial version or purchased from the official website. You can also open and edit these icons with other software that supports the SVG format.

These icons are saved in the `ai` folder, and each icon has a corresponding SVG file in the `svg` folder, which you can view directly in the browser or embed into your webpage.

You can also use Adobe Illustrator to open the .ai project file for editing.

## Examples

Below are some examples of icons that demonstrate different weather conditions.

| Sunny                 | Cloudy                | Light Rain                  | Haze                |
